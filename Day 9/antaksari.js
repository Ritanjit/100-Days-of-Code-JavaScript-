/* Finding last character of a string */

// Playing Antaksari (game of last letters) withn JS....
let songA = "Imagine there's no heaven, Its easy if you try... I hope someday you'll join us, And the world will live as one";


//Finding the last letter.....
const songLastLetter = songA[songA.length -1]; //using length to find last

console.log("\n\nRahul Sings, "+ songA + '"');

console.log("\nPriya : Hurry...Whats a song with\n" + songLastLetter + "!!");
let songB="enna Sonna Kyon, Rab ne Banaya....Enna Sona...Ooo"; //2nd song lyrics
console.log("\nAnjali starts singing" +songB + " ");
